== TL;DR

https://coreos.com/etcd/[etcd, window="_blank"] is a key/value store.
In this project it does not matter if it is specifically etcd being used.
I just needed a key/value store that understands JSON.
If you wish to use another key/value store, please do not hesitate to submit a PR.

== Initial Setup

Setup you installation byr following the instructions from https://coreos.com/etcd/[etcd, window="_blank"].
During development I have used a locally run docker container.
`docker run -d -p 2379:2379 -p 2380:2380 --env "ETCDCTL_API=3" --name etcd quay.io/coreos/etcd:latest /usr/local/bin/etcd --listen-client-urls http://0.0.0.0:2379 --initial-advertise-peer-urls http://localhost:2380 --advertise-client-urls http://localhost:2379`

== Format

The format of the JSON response from etcd is important. Minimum requirements are the following key/value-pairs:
[source,json]
----
{
"hostname": "[RaspberryPi]",
"organizations": ["Organization1", "Organization2", "Organization3"]
}
----
